EMO - Loved With Me

PG 2 Lyric 
Hold her hand, I'll never hold her hands, I'll never get to hold her hand, get to hold her hands.
I'll never understand, I'll never understand, I'll never understand, I'll never get to understand. 
What it means to hold her hand, hold her hands, hold her hand, hold her hands. 
I'll never be her man I'll never be her man I'l never be her man for all I undesrtand. 

Is it the cuts my wrist, is it the drag my hits, is it the mess I makes, the mess I makes in yuor head. 
Is it the way I play, is it the way I blazes it, is it the way I plays with it, vs the way he plays with her.
Is he the devil way is he the devil way I am the devil way I am the devil ways.
Look at the songs I play look a the cuts his wrist look at the look hair his the horns his head.  

Are you in love with him, are you in love with me, are you in love with her, are you in love with your. 
I need to understand, I need to understand, I need to understand, we need to understand.
The demon man would like to hold your hand would like to hold your hand would like to hold your hands.
The demon in my mind cries at night cries at times. 

When you're in love with him, you're not in love with me, you're not in love with me, you're not even into me. 
You are the evil one you are the devils one you are the I am not into ones. 

I'm in her yuh.
I'm in her uh.
I'm in her uh.
We fuck.

I must be the devils baby, I must be the devils baby, I must be the devils baby, I am the devils baby.



Is it the cuts his wrist.
The horns on shadow. 
The Hades hair, this dark brown hair. 
Is it the smoke my cig.
The constant touching, and no talking, no text calling.. 

I'm hold her hand, hold her hand, and I'm quick I'm mad. 
I'm just a psychic man, a psycho man, a shy boy man, a shy boy mad.
