Is it the cuts his wrist, is it the drag his hits, is it the look at the mess he made, look at the mess he’s made.
Is it the way he play, is it the way he blazes it, is it the way he plays with it, is it the way he plays with it.
I’m not the Devil babe, I’m not the devils way, I’m not the devil way, I’m not the Devil babe.
Is it the way I play, is it the way I play, is it the way I play, is it the way I blaze.
I’m not the Devil babe.
