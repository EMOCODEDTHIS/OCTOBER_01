Look at the friend I made, look at the friend I made, look at the friend I made, look at the friend I made. (No one’s around.)
With the demon, with the demon, with the demon livin’ in in in my head. (Kurt Cobain.)
Look at the way we play, look at the way we play, look at the way we play, look at the way he play. (Possesed his body.)
Look at the friend I made, look at the friend I made, look at the friend I made, look at the friend I made. (Happy Ending.)

Is he Kurt Cobain, is he hurt like Kurt Cobain, does he hit the vein, or does he understand his pain. 
They’ll never understand, they’ll never understand, they’ll never understand, she’ll never understand.
Is his heart hurt like Kurt Cobain, is his heart hurt Kurt Cobains or does he or does he understand, understand his brain. 
Does he play like Kurt Cobain, does he play like Kurt Cobain, does he hit the vein, does he hit the vein.

Look at the friend he made, look at the friend he made, look at the way they play, look at the way they play with it.
With the demon, with the demon, with the demon, livin’ in their head.
I hope he understand, I hope he understand, I hope he understand, I hope he understand. 
Look at the way they play, look at the way they play, look at the way they play, look at the way they play with it.

With the demon, livin’ in his head, with the demon living’ in his head. 
I hope he understand, I hope he understand, I hope he understand, I hope he understand dance.
There’s a demon living’ living’ living’ in his head.
Look at the we he play, look at the way he play, look at the way he play with it, look at the way he play with it.

Is his heart Kurt Cobains, is his heart Kurt Cobains, or does he understand, understand his pain. 
I hope he gets away, I hope he gets away, I hope he gets away. 
I never ever, never ever really had a chance with him.

I never had a chance, I never had a chance, I never had a chance. 
I hate you Kurt Cobain, I hate you Kurt Cobain, I hate your Kurt Cobain. 
You took my name, took my name, took my name.
